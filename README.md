# MSc Research Practicum - CNN-LSTM Financial Time-Series Forecasting

This repository contains the MSc research practicum project focused on improving CNN-LSTM hybrid models for financial time-series forecasting. The work emphasizes hyperparameter optimization and overfitting reduction to improve model stability and accuracy across multiple stock markets (India, Ireland, USA).

## Project Structure

- `data/` - Dataset files, organized into raw, cleaned, and prediction outputs.
- `notebooks/` - Jupyter notebooks for data exploration, modeling, and evaluation.
- `README.md` - Project overview and instructions.

## How to Use

1. Explore the data and preprocessing steps in the notebooks.
2. Run the modeling notebooks to train and evaluate CNN-LSTM models.
3. Use the predictions CSV files in `data/predictions/` for visualization or further analysis.

## Tools & Libraries

- Python, Jupyter Notebook
- Pandas, NumPy
- TensorFlow / Keras
- Matplotlib, Seaborn
