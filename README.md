# MSc Research Practicum - CNN-LSTM Financial Time-Series Forecasting

This repository contains the MSc research practicum project focused on improving CNN-LSTM hybrid models for financial time-series forecasting. The work emphasizes hyperparameter optimization and overfitting reduction to improve model stability and accuracy across multiple stock markets (India, Ireland, USA).

## Project Structure

- `data/` - Dataset files, organized into raw, cleaned, and prediction outputs.
- `notebooks/` - Jupyter notebooks for data exploration, modeling, and evaluation.
- `README.md` - Project overview and instructions.
- `requirements.txt` - Python libraries with specific versions required to run the project.

## How to Use

1. Install the required Python libraries using:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt

2.  Explore the data and preprocessing steps in the notebooks.

3. Run the modeling notebooks to train and evaluate CNN-LSTM models.

4. Use the prediction CSV files in `data/predictions/` for visualization or further analysis.


## Tools & Libraries
